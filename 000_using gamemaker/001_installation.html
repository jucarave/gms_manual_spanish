        <h2 class="studio">Instalando <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> para uso personal.</h2>
        
        <p>
            Si tu versión de <i>GameMaker: Studio no</i> ha sido comprada a traves
            de <b>Steam</b>, vas a necesitar ejecutar el programa <tt>GMStudio-Installer.exe</tt>
            y seguir las instrucciones para instalarlo. Tienes las opción de instalar el programa 
            en cualquier llugar que usted lo desee pero es recomendado que siga con las 
            opciones predeterminadas. Una vez la instalación este completa, en el menú de 
            inicio encontrarás un nuevo grupo de programas desde donde puedes iniciar
            <i>GameMaker: Studio</i>.
            <br>
            <br>
            <i><b>NOTA:</b> Si usted compró</i> GameMaker: Studio a traves de <b>Steam</b>,
            el programa debería instalarse automaticamente, dandote la opción de crear 
            un icono en el menú de incio y en el escritorio. Cualquiera de estos pueden ser 
            usados para ejecutar el programa en su computador, ó usted puede ejecutarlo 
            desde la librería de <b>Steam</b> directamente.
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="studio">Requisitos Básicos</h3>
        
        <!-- 
        <p>Any computer that is less than five years old should be able to
        run <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> without any problems, but here are the
        minimum specs for your PC to use the program, and then the
        necessary specs for each of the additional modules that you may
        have.</p>
        
        <blockquote><i><b>IMPORTANT:</b> The required SDK and OS given for
        each platform may be different at the time of use due to changes
        made between updates to GameMaker. You can always find the latest
        requirements from the YoYo Games helpdesk <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/entries/91625158" target="_blank">here</a></i>.</blockquote>
        
        <h4 class="studio">Windows</h4>
        
        <blockquote><i>GameMaker: Studio</i> requires a reasonably modern
        PC running Windows XP, Vista, 7, or later. A DirectX 9 (or later)
        compatible graphics card with at <i>least</i> 32MB of memory is
        required for most created games. It requires a screen resolution of
        at least 1024x768 and 65536 (16-bit) colours (but preferably 32-bit
        true colour). Also a DirectX 9 compatible sound card, or integrated
        sound chip, is required. It is always recommended that you make
        sure you have the most recent drivers installed for your
        system.<br>
        <br>
        <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> requires DirectX version 9.0 or later to
        be installed on your computer. (You can download this version of
        DirectX from the Microsoft website at: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=35" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com</a>.) When designing and
        testing games, the memory requirements can be pretty high (at least
        128 MB and preferably more, but this depends on the operating
        system). When just running games, the memory requirements are less
        severe and depend a lot on the type of game as well as the
        resources being used.<br>
        <br>
        <i><b>NOTE:</b> Although most modern PCs ship with DirectX 10 and
        higher, this does not mean that DirectX 9 is present on your
        machine, and you should still install it from the link given
        above!</i><br>
        <br>
        Please note that Steam users also have an additional target for
        compiling games which is the <b>Steam Workshop</b>. While creating
        and testing your game, this target module will work exactly the
        same as the standard Windows module, however when creating your
        final executable you will be shown additional options to submit the
        game directly to Steam. More information can be found <a href="steam%20workshop.html">here</a>.<br>
        <br>
        
        <hr></blockquote>
        
        <h4 class="studio">Windows 8</h4>
        
        <blockquote>The <b>Professional</b> version of <i>GameMaker:
        Studio</i> comes with the Windows 8 Native and JavaScript target
        platforms as additional targets for free. These targets require a
        Windows 8 OS to run (and for testing), and this can be the main OS
        or a sub-OS that you can dual boot with Windows 7 (or any other OS
        you choose to use), however you <i>cannot</i> create a final
        application for Windows 8 outside of that OS.<br>
        <br>
        You will also need to make sure that you have <b>Microsoft .Net
        Framework 3.5</b> installed (<b>.Net 4</b> is installed as standard
        with Windows 8, but you may need to install the previous version
        too) which is available <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21" target="_blank">here</a>, although when you install <i>GameMaker:
        Studio</i> on your Windows 8 OS it should complete this part
        automatically.<br>
        <br>
        Another thing that is necessary is a copy of <b>Microsoft Visual
        Studio</b> which can be found <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs" target="_blank">here</a>. <i>You must only use VS 2012 (the Express
        versions are fine), so even if you have a previous version of
        Visual Studio, it will not work with this module.</i> A version of
        this product that supports Windows Store JavaScript app creation is
        essential as you will need it to create the <tt>*.pfx</tt> file
        which is your <b>Developer Key</b> and needed to submit your apps
        and games to the Windows Store.<br>
        <br>
        The <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> Windows 8 export target will create an
        app specifically for the Windows 8 OS, and it will be compatible
        with many of the unique features that this OS offers the user.
        However, if you wish to publish this game through the Microsoft
        Store for Windows, you <i>must</i> have a <b>Microsoft Developers
        Licence</b> which is available by signing up for an account
        <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/br229512.aspx">
        here</a>. There is a small cost involved in registering for this
        account and you will need to have a valid bank account and credit
        facilities to be able to monetize any apps that you submit to the
        store.<br>
        <br>
        Further information on setting up the Windows 8 modules can be
        found on the <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/entries/22182733" target="_blank">YoYo Games Helpdesk</a>.<br>

        <hr></blockquote>
        
        <h3 class="studio">Additional Modules</h3>
        
        <p>The above modules are included as standard for all versions of
        <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> but the following modules are available
        only to those who have upgraded to the <b>Professional</b> version
        (more information on the different versions of <i>GameMaker:
        Studio</i> can be found <a href="versions.html">here</a>).<br>
        <br></p>
        
        <h4 class="studio">Mac OS X</h4>
        
        <blockquote>To use the Mac OS X target module, you will need to
        have a Mac computer with an Intel chipset and running Mavericks
        (OSX 10.9) OS or above. You will also need to download and install
        Xcode for your version of the OS (minimum Xcode version 6). It's
        generally recommended that you use the latest OS X and the latest
        Xcode (you can find the version your Mac has by clicking on the
        "Apple" logo in the top left and selecting the "About this Mac"
        option from the drop down menu).<br>
        <br>
        Further information on setting up the Mac OS X module can be found
        on the <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/entries/42365238" target="_blank">YoYo Games Helpdesk</a>.<br>
        <br>
        
        <hr></blockquote>
        
        <h4 class="studio">Ubuntu (Linux)</h4>
        
        <blockquote>The Linux module is designed to be compatible with the
        Ubuntu operating system, and although it should work with other
        Linux systems, it is only guaranteed to work with the latest
        versions of this popular Linux OS.<br>
        <br>
        Further information on setting up the Ubuntu module can be found on
        the <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/entries/23167703" target="_blank">YoYo Games Helpdesk</a>.<br>
        <br>
        
        <hr></blockquote>
        
        <h4 class="studio">iOS</h4>
        
        <blockquote>The <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> iOS module requires that
        you have a Mac computer (or at least access to one) and that it
        meets the minimum requirements for the <b>MacOSX</b> target module
        (see above) and <b>you must be a registered Apple developer and
        have all certificates and licenses up to date</b>. For more
        information on becoming a registered Apple Developer and how to get
        the necessary certificates, please visit the Apple Developer site
        <a href="https://developer.apple.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
        <br>
        Nearly all iOS devices are compatible with <i>GameMaker: Studio</i>
        including:
        
        <blockquote>
        <ul>
        <li>iPhone 4, 4S, 5, 5C, 5S, 6, and 6plus</li>
        
        <li>iPad 1 and above</li>
        
        <li>iPod Touch 3rd Gen and above</li>
        </ul>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>It also doesn't matter if you are testing on an iPhone or an
        iPad as all iOS project builds created by <i>GameMaker: Studio</i>
        are, as standard, universal apps. This means that they will run on
        both iPhone and iPad devices without problems.<br>
        <br>
        Further information on setting up the iOS module can be found on
        the <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/entries/66308323" target="_blank">YoYo Games Helpdesk</a>.<br>
        <br></p>
        
        <hr></blockquote>
        
        <h4 class="studio">Android and Amazon Fire</h4>
        
        <blockquote>Before actually starting to work with <i>GameMaker:
        Studio</i> and Android or Amazon Fire, it is worth noting that the
        devices that will play your game vary immensely in capability. The
        GameMaker: Studio runner will only work with Android
        2.3(Gingerbread) and above (API Level 9 and above in the Android
        SDK), which covers the majority of devices around at the moment but
        not all of them, so please check and make sure which version of
        Android your device uses. It is also recommended that your device
        have a dedicated GPU with OpenGL version 1.1 or above. Devices
        without a GPU will still run your GameMaker: Studio projects, but
        expect them to have a severe drop in performance. The Amazon Fire
        target supports all Fire TV devices, the Fire Stick, and all Fire
        Tablets.<br>
        <br>
        You will also need to download the <b>Android SDK</b> as
        <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> requires some of the components of the
        different Android versions and the Platform Tools it installs. You
        can get a copy of the SDK <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">here</a>. if you are
        also using the YoYo Compiler (YYC) then you will also need to
        install a copy of the <a>Android NDK</a> which can be found
        <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html">here</a>.<br>

        <hr></blockquote>
        
        <h4 class="studio">HTML5</h4>
        
        <blockquote>The HTML5 export module requires only an HTML5
        compliant browser. Note that although most modern browsers are
        capable of running HTML5 games, not all of them support the WebGL
        standard currently, so we recommend Chrome for testing as that
        shows all the features supported by the module.<br>
        <br>
        Further information on setting up the HTML5 module can be found on
        the <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/entries/22899003" target="_blank">YoYo Games Helpdesk</a>.<br>
        <br>
        
        <hr></blockquote>
        
        <h4 class="studio">Windows Phone</h4>
        
        <blockquote>Creating games for the Windows Phone module requires
        that you have installed the <b>Windows Phone SDK 8.0</b> (download
        from <a href="http://dev.windowsphone.com/en-us/downloadsdk" target="_blank">here</a>). You will also need a Windows 8 PC with
        the following specifications:
        
        <blockquote>
        <ul>
        <li>Windows 8, running 64-bit. A 32-bit system is not
        supported.</li>
        
        <li>4GB RAM minimum</li>
        
        <li>6.5GB of disk space</li>
        </ul>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>if you do not have a Windows Phone device, you can make use of
        the <b>Windows Phone emulator</b>, however be aware that these
        additional requirements will also apply in that case:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <ul>
        <li>Windows 8 Professional or Enterprise Edition</li>
        
        <li>Hardware virtualisation</li>
        
        <li>Second Level Address Translation (SLAT)</li>
        
        <li>DHCP, so the virtual machine can get a IP address on the local
        network</li>
        </ul>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p><i><b>NOTE:</b> The Windows Phone SDK will also install
        Microsoft Visual Basic Express for Windows Phone as well, so there
        is no need to install it separately.</i><br>
        <br>
        Further information on setting up the Windows Phone module can be

        <hr></blockquote>
        
        <h4 class="studio">Tizen</h4>
        
        <blockquote>The Tizen target module has certain pre-requisites that
        must be met before being used, the most important of these is that
        you must have installed the Tizen SDK (available You can get the
        SDK <a href="https://developer.tizen.org/downloads/tizen-sdk" target="_blank">here</a>).<br>
        <br>
        <i><b>WARNING!</b>:The current Tizen SDK <b>does not work on
        Windows 8</b>, so you will need to have an earlier OS installed on
        your development machine (you can dual boot to Windows XP, Vista,
        or 7). Also note that the 64bit SDK may not work, even if your OS
        is 64bit, so if in doubt you should choose the 32bit
        version.</i><br>
        <br>
        Apart from that you will also need the following:
        
        <blockquote>
        <ul>
        <li>dual-core 2 GHz CPU</li>
        
        <li>At least 2 GB of RAM memory</li>

        <li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" target="_blank">Oracle Java JDK</a> (v6 or above) installed (do
        <i>not</i> use OpenJDK)</li>
        </ul>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>If you do not have access to a Tizen device, you may be able to
        use the <b>Tizen Emulator</b>, however you must also meet the
        following requirements for it to work correctly:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <ul>
        <li>A CPU that supports Intel VTx</li>
        
        <li>At least 1280 x 1024 screen resolution</li>
        
        <li>The most up to date graphics drivers for OpenGL ES
        acceleration</li>

        <hr></blockquote>
        
        <h4 class="studio">The YoYo Compiler (YYC)</h4>
        
        <blockquote>The YYC takes the normal <i>GameMaker: Studio</i>
        output and then compiles that into native code for the target
        platform, "stripping out" unneeded functions and performing a host
        of other optimisation techniques to create a smaller and
        performance enhanced executable. This can increase your games
        performance by at least two or three times, especially on
        logic-heavy games, and gives an incredible overall boost to
        performance, ideal for those larger or CPU intensive games.<br>
        <br>
        The YYC is really a number of separate modules, one for each
        available target, and will be made available to you when you get
        any supported target module. So if you have, for example, the iOS
        and Android modules, then you will see two new modules added to
        your target list apart from the standard ones - <b>iOS (YYC)</b>
        and <b>Android (YYC)</b>. Should you get other modules at a later
        date, the YYC will update too and show an extra <b>(YYC)</b> module
        for that target platform.
        
        <blockquote><i><b>NOTE:</b> The YYC is not available for the HTML5
        target, nor any of those that are JavaScript (JS) based.</i><br>
        <br>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>The requisites for the YYC target module will depend on the
        original target modules that you have and wish to use it with, as
        they will need to be set up correctly before the YYC will work
        correctly. You can find further information about this from the
